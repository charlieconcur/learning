> People will never forget how you made them feel. ~Maya Angelou

* We base all our decisions on our emotions.
* You can pick tiny little stories; they don't have to be these really big narratives -- running from lions and bad guys.
* We think everyone else is bette -- shame is a killer of our spirit.
* Stories help us connect connect as humans and realize not everyone has their shit together.
* Our brains sync up -- hear of coffee, your olfactory nerves light up.
* All stories are told the same -- running from the FBI or buying a can of soda.
* Emotions are the way we grab the listener and pull them into the story.
* Words are incredibly important and make a big difference in how we describe our feelings in a story.

> Exercise: In 30 seconds tell how you got here.

* Our motor neurons cause the listener to **do** what you are describing.
* Physically describe what is in your body and the listener will feel it in theirs.
* Emotions are what turn simple anecdotes into powerful narratives.
* "You are not alone." <-- Four most powerful words in the English language.
* We crave belonging more than anything else.
* Talk about those deep inner monologues, talk about the sadness for examples, as it will make the happiness more visceral.
* Tell the raw moments.

> Any story you tell is self edited, you don't need to tell everying.
> Not a fan of having a message / morale for the story. Let the story be the message.
> It doesnt have to be all neatly wrapped up.

* Storytelling is the lens by which we view our world, society, culture.
* Pick something you do everyday, stop and ask yourself: How do you feel and where do I feel it?
* The first paragraph of your story is the most important.
  * Build tension with the opening -- create an information gap.
  * Give them an action scene with enough information to catch their attention but not enough to resolve.
  * What did it look like?
  * How did I feel?
* Editing a story:
  * What is the most important thing for me to convey?
  * What am I trying to get across?
  * Take entire sections out.
* Stories don't have to be giant, bombastic ones.
* Find them: Action scenes, transformational events, strong emotions.
* Start with a story that is bursting out of you.
