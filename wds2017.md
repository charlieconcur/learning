## <a name="mainstage"></a>The Main Stage

**What it is:**

The main stage has been our main gathering point for our community. It's a place that we come together to hear from each other on how we are living remarkable lives and what lessons and takeaways we can use for our own journeys.

**What to expect:**

You'll hear unbelievable stories and receive updates from folks in our community. Look for moments of inspiration, challenge, and encouragement with some added surprises.

**When and where:**

Saturday, July 15th and Sunday July, 16th - The Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall

_No RSVP is required. Just show up to each main stage session during the appropriate time and don't forget your name badge._

## <a name="parties"></a>Opening and Closing Parties

**What it is:**

The best part of WDS is the community itself. The opening and closing parties are a great way to meet new folks, make new friends, and to celebrate the experiences we've shared together throughout the weekend.

**What to expect:**

Fun. Community. Celebration. Challenge yourself to meet a couple of new folks at the opening party and to dance the night away with these new friends at the closing party.

**When and where:**

* Opening Party - Friday, July 14th (location and starting time TBA)
* Closing Celebration - Sunday, July 16th (location and starting time TBA)

_No RSVP required. Just come with your name badge and be ready for a great time and to make a new connection._

## <a name="academies"></a>Academies

**What they are:**

Each year we invite a few members of our community (including previous favorite speakers) who want to share their knowledge and expertise on a wide range of different topics. These "Academies" are half-day workshops that take place before and after the WDS main events allowing attendees to choose the topics most interesting to them. They are also the only events open to the general public (on a first come, first served basis, and for an additional price).

**What to expect:**

Learn something new. Get tools and inspiration. Take your game to another level. Previous topics include travel hacking, language learning, book publishing, how to make the most of the WDS experience after WDS, how to create a social movement, and more.

**When and where:**

Wednesday (12th), Thursday (13th), Friday (14th), and Monday (17th)

_Each Academy requires its own registration. Academies are offered at a discounted rate to all registered attendees at $29 per Academy ($59 per Academy for the general public). Topics and the registration process will be announced very soon._

## <a name="attendeeledmeetups"></a>Attendee-Led Meetups

**What it is:**

WDS is all about our community and how we can learn from each other. Each year our attendees host hundreds of meetups throughout the week with 3 specific focuses*:

* **Discover** - Meetups focused on learning from someone (or a group) with specific expertise and experience (e.g. how to learn a new language or what is it like to build and live in a tiny house)
* **Connecting** - Meetups focused on getting together people who share similar passions and interests (e.g. people interested in living and traveling in an RV full-time, yoga enthusiasts, travelers, foodies, etc...)
* **Experience** - Meetups focused on doing something together (e.g. whiskey tasting or urban hiking in Portland)
* _In some meetups you'll find a combination of the focuses mentioned above_

**What to expect:**

Community, adventure, and service personified. This is the heart of what WDS is all about.

**When and where:**

Throughout the entire week of WDS, happening all over Portland.

_A month prior to WDS we will ask for submissions for those that want to host attendee-led meetups (via email) and we'll also explain how to reserve your spot at any of these meetups._

## <a name="additionalactivities"></a>Additional Activities

**What it is:**

Over the week we'll host several different activities with the main focus of doing something together in community and at the same time, creating fun unforgettable memories together.

**What to expect:**

In the past we've hosted a variety of activities including group yoga, engaging discussions, and a mystery bus tour. This year expect more fun social events ranging from active adventures to laid-back social get-togethers.

**When and where:**

The entire WDS week from Tuesday, July 11th - Monday, July 17th

_More information to be announced in June regarding these events, their times and locations, and how to RSVP._
