## Growing Your Software

* Accretion
  * provide more
* Relaxation
  * require less
* Fixation
  * bash bugs

## Breaking Your Software

* Require more
* Provide less
* Unrelated stuff under same name

## Change Is Not A Thing

* It's one of two things
  * Growth
  * Breakage
* In the small (fns), spec can help us determine which, prevent breaking specs
* As long as we don't try to do something silly like versioning specs!
